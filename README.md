    <h1>Music Store Data Analysis Project using SQL</h1>
    <p>
        This project demonstrates the use of SQL to analyze a relational database of a fictional music store. 
        The database includes multiple interconnected tables, such as customers, invoices, employees, tracks, 
        artists, albums, and genres. By addressing key business queries, the analysis provides actionable 
        insights to optimize operations and decision-making.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills and Tools:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Leveraged SQL techniques, including joins, subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and window functions.</li>
        <li>Worked with MySQL/PostgreSQL for executing complex queries on structured data.</li>
        <li>Applied data modeling and optimization techniques to improve query performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Project Workflow:</h2>
    <h3>Schema Understanding:</h3>
    <p>Analyzed a schema with 10+ tables, identifying relationships and designing appropriate queries.</p>

    <h3>Business Questions:</h3>
    <p>Addressed 20+ queries, grouped into three difficulty levels (Easy, Moderate, Advanced). Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identifying the top-spending customers and the best-selling artist.</li>
        <li>Determining the most popular genre in each country.</li>
        <li>Calculating customer expenditures on tracks longer than the average duration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Analysis and Insights:</h3>
    <p>Extracted and visualized insights to support decision-making.</p>

    <h2>Key Outcomes and Insights:</h2>
    <p><strong>5+ Actionable Insights:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Determined the top city for revenue generation to plan a promotional event.</li>
