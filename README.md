**Music Store Data Analysis Project using SQL**

This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze a relational database for a fictional music store. The database includes interconnected tables such as customers, invoices, employees, tracks, artists, albums, and genres. The analysis addresses key business queries and provides actionable insights to optimize operations and improve decision-making.

**Skills and Tools:**
- Utilized SQL techniques, including joins, subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and window functions.
- Worked with MySQL/PostgreSQL to execute complex queries on structured data.
- Applied data modeling and optimization techniques to enhance query performance.

**Project Workflow:**

1. **Schema Understanding:**  
   Analyzed a schema with over 10 tables, identifying relationships and designing appropriate queries.

2. **Business Questions:**  
   Addressed over 20 queries, grouped into three difficulty levels (Easy, Moderate, Advanced). Examples include:
   - Identifying the top-spending customers and best-selling artist.
   - Determining the most popular genre in each country.
   - Calculating customer expenditures on tracks longer than the average duration.

3. **Analysis and Insights:**  
   Extracted and visualized insights to support decision-making.

**Key Outcomes and Insights:**
- **5+ Actionable Insights:**
   - Determined the top city for revenue generation to plan a promotional event.
   - Identified the highest-spending customer, aiding in the design of a loyalty program.
   - Highlighted the most popular genres by country for regional marketing campaigns.
   - Supported data-driven decisions for business strategy and customer targeting.
